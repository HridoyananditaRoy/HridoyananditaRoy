- ⚡ Fun fact: Everyone tells that a student who is persuing an Engineering degree is an Engineer,                        
               But the title Engineer is itself greater than any Engineering Degree,                                      
               As Any Student with relevant skills can be called an Engineer,                                                            But not all Engineering Graduates are called Engineers.
